# ToDoOrganizer By Alexander Le
 My first Android app that used to connect to a Firebase database until it was deactivated (Update, it is now activated at https://studentprojectfailure3.firebaseio.com/).  
 
 What it can do: 
 - post messages to a list
 - swipe left to delete a message
 - update a remote database with data containing the message and the number of votes
 - the update the list of messages when data in the database is changed. 
 
 
 To do:
 - add a sort button to sort messages ranking by votes.
